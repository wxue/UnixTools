UnixTools
=========
These tools were built up during a class called "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment". You can [view the website](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631A/) of this class. 

Instructor of this class, [Jan Schaumann](https://github.com/jschauma) also put the [materials of this class](https://github.com/jschauma/cs631apue) on github(very cool), you should check it out.

The tools I built here is more like learning tools for UNIX environment programming. Of course, you can use the tools as a real tool as their demonstration, however, you can always find similar but more powerful, much more powerful, tools on you Linux or Mac or other UNIX-like system.

So this may be more interesting for other learners, students of this class, or UNIX fans, but not the ones only seeking for powerful tools. 

However, you are all welcome to use the code and fork this project, and I'm appreciate for any comments related to this project.


## Usage:

#### Fetch the code
You can clone the tools' directories into your computer or download the whole package as a zip file then unzip it.

#### Compile it
Open a terminal, `cd` to the very directory of the tool.

###### Use makefile
* Simply use `make` command. Then, it's done compile and ready to use.

###### Manually
* Please use gcc as the compiler. Use `man gcc` for more details.

Just for the record, my gcc version is 4.2.1.

#### To be more specific
Each of the tools gets their own README file, you can check them out for the usage of each tool.


## Set PATH Variable

In order to use these tools more "Unix-like" in a terminal, you can add the directory path of the tools into the PATH variable. 

##### Set the PATH variable by running the command below:

  1. `export PATH=/tool_path/tool_directory:$PATH`

    Replace `/tool_path/tool_directory` with the path and the directory of the very tool(the executable file).

  2. Use command `echo $PATH` to check if it is added correctly.

This only changes the PATH variable temperately. So, if you open a new terminal
you need to do this again. 

###### You can also change the PATH variable permanently by modifying `.bashrc` (on Linux) or `/etc/paths` (on Mac OS).
